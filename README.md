# raspberry pi pico codes

these are various codes i make with the pi pico (feel free to use any as long as u credit me on github!)

## what the codes do

### morsecode.py
* only need a pi pico
* accepts an input phrase/string and converts it to morse code on the pi picos built in led
* any letter not found in the Dictionary of Morsekeys will not be displayed (waiting 0.4 seconds)
* s starts for short, l stands for long
